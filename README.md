<h1>Backtracking for Sudoku</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

A Sudoku puzzle is a logic-based, combinatorial, number-placement puzzle.

The modern Sudoku lends itself quite naturally to the study of mathematics and mathematical computation due to its connections to abstract algebra, combinatorics, and graph theory (in pure maths), backtracking algorithms (in computer science), and stochastic based algorithms (in statistics).

The aim of this project is to touch on a few of the above mentioned connections. The report is quite long and has several points that we investigate. I provide a table that summarises our exploration.
